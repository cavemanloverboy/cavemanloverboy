# About Me (Twitter: @cavemanloverboy)

I work on a lot of things including non-equilibrium fluid dynamics, cosmology (large scale structure and scalar field dark matter), machine learning, distributed systems, smart contracts, (financial) derivatives.

# Check out my crates!

### bosque: a fast in-place kD-tree library
A very fast in-place kD-tree library with no storage overhead. As it is intended for cosmology, it only works for 3D data as is but is easily generalized.
https://github.com/cavemanloverboy/bosque

### sol: a command line explorer for the solana bockchain
Inspect transactions and accounts (coming soon) directly from your terminal.
https://github.com/cavemanloverboy/sol

### sha2-const-stable: sha2-const, but stable
Calculate sha2 hashes (sha224, sha256, sha384, sha512) at compile time using stable rust!
https://github.com/cavemanloverboy/sha2-const-stable

### solana-nostd-entrypoint: a zerocopy, no_alloc/no_std entrypoint for solana programs
https://github.com/cavemanloverboy/solana-nostd-entrypoint

### sokoban-bindings: using sokoban in C/C++/Zig
Use the highly efficient zerocopy data structures of `sokoban` in C, C++, or Zig!
https://github.com/ellipsis-labs/sokoban-bindings

### oxylana: full stack solana development in rust
A template repository that includes a smart contract, frontend, client and test suite all in Rust.
https://github.com/cavemanloverboy/oxylana

### zipper: an anti-rug & anti-sandwich primitive
A smart contract that zips transactions, preventing sandwiches and rugs.
https://github.com/cavemanloverboy/zipper

### packed_bools: a lightweight ergonomic bit manipulation library for packing booleans
https://crates.io/crates/packed_bools

### cosmology: a rust crate for cosmology
An early-in-development crate intended to eventually include lots of utilities commonly used in cosmology
https://crates.io/crates/cosmology

### interp1d: a simple rust crate for 1D linear interpolation
https://crates.io/crates/interp1d

### anchor-viz: visualizing anchor programs
A color-coded visualization tool for the instructions of an anchor program.
